# OpenAI Chat - Shopify Frontend Intern Challenge

This project was created using JavaScript/React.<br><br>
The deployed application is viewable here: [https://chatbot-openai.herokuapp.com/](https://chatbot-openai.herokuapp.com/)

## What it is
It's an instant messenger that simulates a conversation with a friend using OpenAI's API. 

## How to use it
The application is fairly straightforward.<br><br>
Enter a question you might ask a friend or an acquaintance. <br> 
The more specific you are the better the reponse will be. Then hit send when you're ready. <br>  <br> 

<b>There are two checkboxes:</b> <br> 
Info displays instructions and additional information <br> 
Log shows the chat history in newest to oldest ordering. <br> 
<br><br>
The main window and chat history window are draggable but the minimize and close buttons are currently only there for style reasons.

## What's next
I'd like to implement it into my portoflio website [here](https://arusnac.github.io/).<br>
As you'll notice the styling is similar. Once I do that the 'window buttons' can have a purpose, they're currently there only to fit the aesthetic.
